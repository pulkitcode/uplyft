# Firestore
Firestore will be used to store the data for our project.
In case there's any confusion Firebase refers to Google's realtime database service as a whole. Firestore is the new and improved version (aka Firebase 2.0).
You can find the Firestore project [here](https://console.firebase.google.com/u/0/project/project-iris-54ea9/database/)

# Trello
Used to store our tasks and keep on track with the work everyone is doing
You can find the Trello board [here](https://trello.com/b/G0gls9K6/mission-control)

# Slack
Used to communicate with the team quickly
You can find the Slack [here](https://buddyuptalk.slack.com/home)

# Tools Being Used
- Flutter (Cross-platform mobile framework for building the front end)
- Firestore (To store and retrieve data)
- Google App Engine (To run our api and cloud functions for app functionality)

# Important Concepts
- [Agile](https://www.atlassian.com/agile) is an iterative approach to project management and software development that helps teams deliver value to their customers faster and with fewer headaches. Instead of betting everything on a "big bang" launch, an agile team delivers work in small, but consumable, increments. Requirements, plans, and results are evaluated continuously so teams have a natural mechanism for responding to change quickly.
- [SCRUM Framework](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/scrum) Scrum is a framework that helps teams work together. It is under the umbrella of Agile. Scrum encourages teams to learn through experiences, self-organize while working on a problem, and reflect on their wins and losses to continuously improve.
